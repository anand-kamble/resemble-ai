## Hacker News Front Page Replica

My name is Anand Kamble, and I am submitting my code for the take home test. 
I have implemeted redux and react router as well. I am not sure if i have to implement tablulation in this project or not. so I have skipped that part. 

I have implemented the redux store such that it will handle the async call to api and will update the state. I have also added loading and failure state which will be useful to implement an loader in case needed or to show a toast when the api call fails. 

Also, I have structured the repo in such way that it can be scaled to a large application with multiple pages and components.

I hope to hear back from you soon!
